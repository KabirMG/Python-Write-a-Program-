# Arithmetic Operators (6 Types)
#  ADD, SUB, MULTI, DIVI, MOD & EXPO  

int1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))

# Addition	x + y

# Subtraction	x - y

# Multiplication	x * y

# Division	x / y  
division_int = int1 / int2

# Modulus	x % y

# Exponentiation	x ** y

# OUTPUT
# Enter first number: 10
# Enter second number: 5
# ADDITION of the two numbers  10 + 5 = 15
# SUBSTRACTION of the two numbers  10 - 5 = 5
# MULTIPLICATION of the two numbers   10 * 5 = 50
# DIVISION of the two numbers   10 / 5 = 2.0
# MODULUS of the two numbers   10 / 5 = 0
# EXPONENTIAL of the two numbers   10 / 5 = 100000
